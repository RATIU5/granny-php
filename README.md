# Granny PHP

## Getting started

To install Granny, run the following command on your system. Make sure you have Git installed first.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RATIU5/granny-php ~/Documents/GitHub/
```

(You can change `~/Documents/GitHub/` to whatever location you choose to install Granny to)

### Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is needed for Granny to work. Without it, Granny will refuse to work.

Install Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Start Docker Desktop.

Next, open your terminal to wherever you installed (cloned) Granny to and run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

(If you are using Linux, this command will need to be installed separately, and run as
`docker compose up`)

## Starting Granny

To start Granny after an install, simply open Docker Desktop and run the Granny container
